Simple data store and presentation

# Project Goals
## 1. Simple to use API
  The Project should provide a simple to use api to save and retrive Data stored in a PostgreSQL database.
## 2. Simple to use Management/Visualisations of Data
  It should be easy for the user to manage datasets (e.g. add new Set/delete set) and show different graphs for each dataset.
  For this purpose, we need to build a easy to use website. 
  The graphs then can be displayed using Graph.js (https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js)
